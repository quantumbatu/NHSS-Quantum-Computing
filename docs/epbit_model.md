# Ep-bit Model

An Ep-bit stores information not in amplitudes but in the **topological
relationship** of a quantum system to an Exceptional Point (EP).

EP dynamics:
- One loop (~2π): eigenstate switching
- Two loops (~4π): return to initial state

Ep-bit logic:
- OUTSIDE EP → logical 0  
- INSIDE EP → logical 1  

NHSS maps measurement-feedback-controlled circuits to EP-like trajectories.
