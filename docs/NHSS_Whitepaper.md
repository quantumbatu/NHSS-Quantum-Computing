# NHSS Whitepaper (Draft)

## Abstract
NHSS introduces a non-Hermitian, EP-driven quantum computation model.
Information is stored topologically via Ep-bits.

## NHSS Model
Measurement + feedback creates an effective Hamiltonian:
H_eff = H + iγZ

## Ep-bit Computation
EP loops cause eigenstate switching → logical transitions.

## Implementation
IBM Dynamic Circuits allow:
- mid-circuit measurement  
- feed-forward  
- reset  

## Conclusion
NHSS offers a topological alternative to amplitude-based computation.
