# NHSS Theory Summary

NHSS (Non-Hermitian Spectral Steering) uses measurement-driven,
non-unitary evolution to create an effective Hamiltonian:

H_eff = H + iγZ

This produces **Exceptional Points (EPs)**, where eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce.  
Encircling EPs yields topological transitions used for computation.

Key elements:
- Mid-circuit measurement  
- Conditional feedback  
- Non-Hermitian spectral flow  
- Ep-bit as a topological information unit
